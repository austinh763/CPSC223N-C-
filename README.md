Assignment 1: Flashing red stop light(designing a UI, implementing a timer, pause/exit buttons).

Assignment 2: Traffic light program(declaring an internal clock and setting its speed, attaching a listener to a clock, pausing clock and restarting it).

Assignment 3: Moving circle along the edge of a rectangle(using two clocks in one UI, how one clock controls refresh rate of entire UI, how another clock controls frequency of updating the coordinates of the ball, using a C# coordinate system).

Midterm: Changing the color of the ball from assignment 3 with different choices of colors.

Assignment 4: Ball bouncing along the edges of a frame(shows how refresh rate and motion rate are different, relationships between ball speeds and animation clock speed, mathematically bounce a ball off a surface, converting traditional angles into computer graphic angles).

Assignment 5: Clicking on moving circles before they hit a boundary (read coordinates of the cursor into x/y variables, making random integer generator).

Final: A point that draws a flower (converting mathematical formula into cartesian using calculus, writing a bitmap in memory). Changing the color of the flower trace by clicking the tip/point while flower is being drawn.
